If a future ézíhub product processes additional categories of data, a product‑specific notice will be provided at the point of collection.

## 3) Personal data we collect
- Contact details: first name, last name, email, company, role/interest

- Preferences: newsletter subscriptions and consent choices
- Usage and device data: pages visited, referrers, general device/browser information (aggregated or pseudonymous)

We do not intentionally collect special category data via our website forms.

## 4) How we collect data

## 6) Legal bases (UK/EU GDPR)
Where GDPR applies, we rely on one or more of the following:
- Consent (e.g., newsletters)
- Legitimate interests (operate, secure, and improve Services; respond to enquiries)
- Legal obligation (comply with law and lawful requests)

## 7) Cookies and similar technologies
We may use cookies and similar technologies to operate the site and understand engagement. You can control cookies through your browser settings. Where required by law, we will present consent controls.

## 8) Analytics
We may use privacy‑respecting analytics to understand aggregated usage and improve performance. Analytics data is generally pseudonymous. We do not use analytics to make automated decisions about you.

## 9) Sharing your information
We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with:
- Service providers (hosting, analytics, email delivery) under contractual confidentiality and data‑processing terms
- Professional advisers (legal, accounting) under duty of confidentiality
- Authorities where required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security

## 10) International transfers
Your information may be processed in the UK, the EEA, or other countries where our providers operate. When transferring data internationally, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., UK/EU Standard Contractual Clauses) where required.

## 11) Data retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy.
- Waitlist & newsletter data: until you unsubscribe or request deletion
- Contact enquiries: up to 24 months after last interaction (unless longer retention is required by law)
- Technical logs: typically 90–180 days, unless required for security investigations

## 12) Security
We apply reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. No method is completely secure, and we continually improve our safeguards.

## 13) Your rights
Subject to local law, you may have rights to:
- Access a copy of your personal data
- Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data
- Erase data in certain circumstances
- Restrict or object to processing based on legitimate interests
- Port data in a machine‑readable format

To exercise your rights, contact hello@ezihub.com. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

### California (CPRA/CCPA)
California residents have additional rights including access, deletion, and information about categories of personal information collected, sources, purposes, and disclosures. We do not sell or share personal information for cross‑context behavioural advertising.

## 14) Children’s privacy
Our Services are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data to us, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

## 15) Third‑party links
Our website may contain links to third‑party sites. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies; we are not responsible for them.

## 16) Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new effective date, and, where appropriate, notify you of material changes.
